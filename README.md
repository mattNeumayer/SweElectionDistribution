# SweElectionDistribution

A python script that can calcuate the [Sainte-LaguÃ« method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method) for seat distribution of parlaments.

In particular, I used this script to calculate the Swedish Riksdag's seat distribution and was able to verify the outcome of the 2018 election.

This script also contains some hypothetical calculation of the votes each party would have to gain / lose to get n more / less seats.
The result can be found in output.png.
